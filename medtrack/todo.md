# To-do

* Pagination for history list.
* In history list, change X icon to trash icon.
* In history list entries, change logic for deviation text color
    * Default text color (not blue) but fainter (like it's disabled) when deviation <= 5%
    * Red when deviation > 5%
* In history list entries, deviation text should be smaller.
* Double-check the adherence calculations.
* If there's no history yet, don't even display the history section.
* Prohibit the selection of a future date in either new or edit dose modals.
* Add a M/W/F schedule (same time each day)?
