Create a mobile-friendly React web application to help a person succeed at achieving the remote viewing master plan. 

Use React, vite, TypeScript, prettier, and linting. Always use the latest versions available of these dependencies.

Linus Torvalds will be reviewing this application, so it needs to be up to his ridiculously high standards.
